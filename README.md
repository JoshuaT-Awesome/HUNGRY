This is an app that makes calls and retrieves data from the Yelp API.

This was my first ever app using React.JS and I will say I'm pleased with how easy React is to work with. If you have any upgrades in mind let me know or do a pull request.  Thanks for stopping by!

P.S. Don't forget to update with 'npm run build' when making changes and also deploy to surge from the build directory.
